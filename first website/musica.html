            A mariner under a sky moonlit
            On an island of a crewless ship
            A few decades of immortality ahead
            A one-man crew for a one-way trip

            Islands, islands everywhere
            I keep my range with crowded sails
            My waves they kiss every shore I land
            Steep cliffs will mark my waving hand

            Islanders, villagers, universal mariners
            Calling me, guiding me
            Monsters far beneath
            Hurricanes on the way
            Lunatic weathervanes
            Shipwrecked lovers on a far away cay

            Passing by butterflies, fluttering for a day
            Jokers, jesters, goddesses, hominidae
            Deep delicious blue beneath
            I'll steer wherever tomorrow is near

            Light a beacon so I can navigate
            Through the tempest, through the madness
            Light a home fire for the sad man
            With a begging hand

            Light a beacon so I can navigate
            Through the tempest
            Following the quintet
            Ride on the highest wave
            Bring me to life
            To them who dance in the daylight

            Sail and seek
            The starbound quay
            Calling you, calling me
            To be a part of your story

            Here, raining ash to cover the dead
            An island of the past wrecks
            Of you, of the endless sundown
            Hemlock meadows, deepest quicksand
            Empty harbor by a wasteland
            Mirrors, mirrors everywhere
            For you of mad despair

            Friends who were for a time
            Now grapes of sour wine
            Lords of a single fly
            Still, I rue no island
            Of shared solitude

            You who glow in deepest woe
            Let it be, retiree, the water's fine
            Sail carefree
            
            Sail and seek
            The starbound quay
            Calling you, calling me
            To be a part of your story
            On these strange islands
        </pre>
